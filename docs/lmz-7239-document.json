  "document":"Of course. Here is a detailed action plan based on the provided text, using the reference issue LMZ-7239.\n\n---\n\n### **Action Plan: LMZ-7239 - Codebase Refactoring & SOLID Implementation**\n\n**Objective:** To address the critical technical debt in the codebase by performing a structured refactoring. The primary goal is to improve maintainability, reduce complexity, and establish a clear, scalable architecture by adhering to SOLID principles. The final deliverable is a comprehensive Pull Request (PR) for review by the staff engineering team.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 1: Analysis & Scoping (The \"Triage\" Phase)**\n\n*Goal: Understand the current state of the codebase to define a clear scope and success metrics. Do not write any production code in this phase.*\n\n1.  **Identify \"Hotspots\":**\n    *   **Action:** Use static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube, CodeClimate) and git history analysis (e.g., `git log --stat`) to identify the most complex, frequently changed, and bug-prone modules. These are the primary candidates for refactoring.\n    *   **Action:** Collaborate with the team to pinpoint areas of the code that are hardest to understand, test, or modify. These are often referred to as \"shambles.\"\n\n2.  **Establish a Baseline:**\n    *   **Action:** Document key metrics *before* any changes are made. This is crucial for proving the refactor was successful.\n        *   **Test Coverage:** Generate a code coverage report for the targeted modules.\n        *   **Performance:** Benchmark critical application pathways that might be affected.\n        *   **Code Quality Metrics:** Record cyclomatic complexity, code duplication, and other relevant metrics from your analysis tools.\n\n3.  **Define Scope & Boundaries:**\n    *   **Action:** Create a definitive list of modules, classes, and services that are **IN SCOPE** for this refactoring effort under LMZ-7239.\n    *   **Action:** Explicitly list what is **OUT OF SCOPE** to prevent scope creep (e.g., \"UI components and the legacy reporting module are out of scope for this ticket\").\n    *   **Action:** Break down the in-scope work into smaller, logical sub-tasks and create them in the project management tool, linking them back to LMZ-7239.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Planning & Strategy**\n\n*Goal: Create a clear technical plan for how the refactoring will be executed based on SOLID principles.*\n\n1.  **Branching Strategy:**\n    *   **Action:** Create a dedicated feature branch from the main development branch.\n    *   **Branch Name:** `refactor/LMZ-7239-solid-principles`\n\n2.  **SOLID Refactoring Strategy:**\n    *   *For each in-scope module, plan the refactoring according to the five SOLID principles. The following are a guide to the thought process:*\n\n    *   **S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**\n        *   **Plan:** Identify classes that are doing too much (e.g., a `UserService` that both manages user data and sends emails). Plan to split these into smaller, more focused classes (e.g., `UserService`, `UserNotifier`, `UserRepository`).\n\n    *   **O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**\n        *   **Plan:** Find large `if/else` or `switch` statements that change whenever a new type is added (e.g., a `calculatePrice` function with different logic for different customer types). Plan to replace these with a more extensible pattern like the Strategy Pattern or Factory Pattern, using interfaces or abstract base classes.\n\n    *   **L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**\n        *   **Plan:** Review class hierarchies. If a subclass cannot be used wherever its parent class is expected without causing errors, the hierarchy is broken. Plan to remodel these inheritance chains to ensure substitutability.\n\n    *   **I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**\n        *   **Plan:** Look for \"fat\" interfaces that force implementing classes to define methods they don't need. Plan to break these down into smaller, role-specific interfaces (e.g., `IReadRepository`, `IWriteRepository` instead of one large `IRepository`).\n\n    *   **D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**\n        *   **Plan:** Identify areas where high-level modules directly depend on low-level implementation details (e.g., `OrderProcessor` directly instantiating `SQLDatabaseConnection`). Plan to introduce abstractions (interfaces) and use Dependency Injection (DI) to \"invert\" the control. The `OrderProcessor` should depend on an `IDatabaseConnection` interface, not a concrete class.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Execution & Implementation**\n\n*Goal: Carry out the refactoring in an incremental, safe, and test-driven manner.*\n\n1.  **Write Tests First:**\n    *   **Action:** For any piece of code you intend to refactor, ensure it has solid unit and integration test coverage *first*. These tests will act as a safety net, guaranteeing that the existing behavior does not change after refactoring.\n\n2.  **Refactor Incrementally:**\n    *   **Action:** Tackle one sub-task or one SOLID principle at a time.\n    *   **Action:** Use a \"Strangler Fig\" approach where possible: introduce new, clean implementations alongside the old ones, and slowly migrate the application to use the new code, eventually \"strangling\" and removing the old code.\n    *   **Action:** Commit frequently with clear, descriptive messages that reference the ticket number. Example: `refactor(PaymentService): Apply SRP to separate payment processing and logging [LMZ-7239]`\n\n3.  **Maintain a Clean History:**\n    *   **Action:** Keep the `refactor/LMZ-7239-solid-principles` branch up-to-date with the main development branch by regularly rebasing or merging to avoid a massive merge conflict at the end.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Validation & Quality Assurance**\n\n*Goal: Verify that the refactoring was successful and did not introduce regressions.*\n\n1.  **Run All Tests:**\n    *   **Action:** Execute the entire test suite (unit, integration, and end-to-end) to confirm that no existing functionality has been broken.\n\n2.  **Compare Against Baseline:**\n    *   **Action:** Re-run the metrics gathered in Phase 1.\n        *   Verify that test coverage has increased or remained high.\n        *   Confirm that performance has not degraded in critical pathways.\n        *   Demonstrate improvement in code quality scores (lower complexity, less duplication).\n\n3.  **Peer Review:**\n    *   **Action:** Before creating the final PR, ask a colleague for an informal review of the branch to catch any obvious issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 5: Delivery & Review**\n\n*Goal: Formally submit the work for review by the staff engineering team.*\n\n1.  **Create the Pull Request (PR):**\n    *   **Action:** Push the feature branch and create a PR targeting the main development branch.\n    *   **PR Title:** `Refactor: Apply SOLID Principles to Core Modules (LMZ-7239)`\n\n2.  **Write a Detailed PR Description:**\n    *   **Action:** The PR description is critical. It must clearly explain the \"why\" and \"how\" of the changes. Structure it as follows:\n        *   **Link to Issue:** `Resolves LMZ-7239`\n        *   **Problem Statement:** Briefly describe the \"shambles\" state of the code (high complexity, poor maintainability) that prompted this work.\n        *   **Solution Overview:** High-level summary of the refactoring approach, mentioning the focus on SOLID principles.\n        *   **Key Changes (with examples):**\n            *   Provide \"before\" and \"after\" code snippets for the most impactful changes.\n            *   Explain how each major change aligns with a specific SOLID principle (e.g., \"Separated the `ReportGenerator` from the `DataFetcher` to adhere to SRP.\").\n        *   **Validation:** Include a summary of the baseline comparison results (e.g., \"Code complexity in the `Order` module was reduced by 30%, and test coverage was increased from 65% to 90%\").\n        *   **How to Test:** Provide clear, step-by-step instructions for reviewers to manually test and verify the changes in a staging environment if applicable.\n\n3.  **Request Review:**\n    *   **Action:** Assign the designated **staff engineers** as reviewers on the PR.\n    *   **Action:** Be prepared to answer questions, discuss the approach, and make further revisions based on their feedback. Be proactive in responding to comments.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 6: Post-Merge Activities**\n\n*Goal: Finalize the process and ensure knowledge is shared.*\n\n1.  **Merge and Deploy:**\n    *   **Action:** Once the PR is approved, merge it into the main development branch.\n\n2.  **Update Documentation:**\n    *   **Action:** Update any relevant architectural diagrams, README files, or developer documentation to reflect the new code structure.\n\n3.  **Monitor:**\n    *   **Action:** After deployment, closely monitor application logs and performance dashboards to ensure the refactoring has not introduced any unforeseen issues in production."
